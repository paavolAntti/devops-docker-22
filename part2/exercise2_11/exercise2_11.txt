I had NodeJS backend for keeping track of lendable devices. The application uses MariaDB as database.
Before both of these environments were running on my local machine. For this exercise I wrote Dockerfile for the
NodeJS & Express API and docker-compose.yml to handle the database connection to the API development container.
On top of this i configured phpMyAdmin-container for easy database access which makes debugging more userfriendly.

NodeJS-container shares a volume in local computer so it can be developed in local machine and run on the container
environment. All the containers run in same docker-network so they can talk to each other.

Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for this project are located in this folder.
